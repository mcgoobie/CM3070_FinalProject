# CM3070_FinalYearProject
## Habits the cat : A React-Native/Expo Application

This project was done for my final year in SIM-UOL's Computer Science degree.

The aim of my project, which is derived from the research I have conducted would be to deliver a mobile application called “Habits the Cat” capable of cultivating good habits in individuals through positive reinforcement and encouragement as a virtual companion.

The deliverable features of this application would be an interactive virtual companion that would encourage you to engage in a set of daily tasks. The tasks in question would be,
-	Exercising for 30 minutes a day, 
-	keeping yourself hydrated, 
-	making sure you have an adequate calorie intake,
-	receiving proper hours of sleep(7 hours a day).
